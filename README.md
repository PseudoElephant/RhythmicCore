# RhythmicCore
Rhythm game where the interface uses real music notation. 
---
So far the only thing implemented is a data structure to handle sheet music notation, as well as the corresponding tests.

The main logic scripts are LevelController, LevelControllerConfig and LevelControllerData.

All tests are located under the tests subfolder.
